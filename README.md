## Install

```sh
yarn add --dev linter-farch-cli
```

or

```sh
npm i --save-dev linter-farch-cli
```

## Usage

Once installed, a small and quick configuration is needed in the `package.json` file.  
The `package.json` file is used here to avoid creating another file with a purpose of configuration.

### Configuration:

In the `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "farch": {
    "src": "([a-z]*-[0-9]{4})[.]*[a-z]*",
    "src/utilities": "[a-z]*"
  }
}
```

Inside the `farch` property, insert the directory that you want to test.  
Pass as `key`, the path from the root directory to the target directory, then in value pass `regex` to match.  
**Then, you are all set!**

### Execution

At the root of your project:

```sh
farch
```
